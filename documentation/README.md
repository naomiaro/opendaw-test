# Building a DAW UI with OpenDAW

This documentation explains how to build a browser-based Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) user interface using OpenDAW's headless audio engine.

## Who is this for?

This guide is for developers who:
- Want to build a DAW in the browser
- Have web development experience (React, TypeScript, Canvas)
- Are new to DAW architecture and audio programming concepts
- Need to understand OpenDAW's PPQN-based timing system

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Concept: AnimationFrame

**Before you start coding**, understand this:

OpenDAW's observables **will not work** without `AnimationFrame.start(window)`. This is the #1 cause of "why isn't my UI updating?" issues.

**‚Üí Read [AnimationFrame Guide](./07-animation-frame.md) first if you're having issues with observables not updating.**

## Quick Reference

### Core Formulas

**Convert PPQN to Pixels:**
```typescript
pixels = (ppqnPosition / totalPPQNDuration) * timelineWidthInPixels
```

**Convert Seconds to PPQN:**
```typescript
ppqn = PPQN.secondsToPulses(durationInSeconds, bpm)
```

**Musical Positions (constant):**
```typescript
const { Quarter } = PPQN; // Always 960

beatOne = 0 * Quarter;           // 0
beatTwo = 1 * Quarter;           // 960
oneBar = 4 * Quarter;            // 3840 (in 4/4 time)
eighthNote = Quarter / 2;        // 480
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | Changes with BPM? |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `PPQN.Quarter = 960` | Resolution constant | ‚ùå Never |
| Clip position | Musical beat location | ‚ùå Never |
| Clip duration | Audio length in PPQN | ‚úÖ Yes |
| BPM | Playback speed | ‚úÖ User adjustable |

### Essential Imports

```typescript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: AnimationFrame (start before creating project!)
import { AnimationFrame } from "@opendaw/lib-dom";

// PPQN utilities
import { PPQN } from "@opendaw/lib-dsp";

// Core project
import { Project, InstrumentFactories } from "@opendaw/studio-core";

// Boxes
import { AudioFileBox, AudioRegionBox } from "@opendaw/studio-boxes";

// Enums
import { AudioPlayback } from "@opendaw/studio-enums";

// Utilities
import { UUID } from "@opendaw/lib-std";

// Rendering
import { PeaksPainter } from "@opendaw/lib-fusion";
```

### AnimationFrame Setup (Required!)

```typescript
// AnimationFrame.start(window) is called automatically by initializeOpenDAW()
const project = await initializeOpenDAW();

// Now you can subscribe to observables (they work!)
project.engine.isPlaying.subscribe(obs => {
  setIsPlaying(obs.getValue()); // ‚úì Updates!
});
```

**Note:** The `initializeOpenDAW()` function handles calling `AnimationFrame.start(window)` internally. If you're not using this helper function, you must call `AnimationFrame.start(window)` before creating your project.

## Common Patterns

### Create a Track with Audio Clip

```typescript
project.editing.modify(() => {
  // 1. Create track
  const { audioUnitBox, trackBox } = project.api.createInstrument(
    InstrumentFactories.Tape
  );

  // 2. Create audio file metadata
  const fileUUID = UUID.generate();
  const audioFileBox = AudioFileBox.create(boxGraph, fileUUID, box => {
    box.fileName.setValue("audio.wav");
    box.endInSeconds.setValue(audioBuffer.duration);
  });

  // 3. Create clip on timeline
  const clipDuration = PPQN.secondsToPulses(audioBuffer.duration, bpm);

  AudioRegionBox.create(boxGraph, UUID.generate(), box => {
    box.regions.refer(trackBox.regions);
    box.file.refer(audioFileBox);
    box.playback.setValue(AudioPlayback.NoSync);
    box.position.setValue(0 * Quarter);
    box.duration.setValue(clipDuration);
    box.loopDuration.setValue(clipDuration);
  });
});
```

### Handle BPM Changes

```typescript
function handleBpmChange(newBpm: number) {
  project.editing.modify(() => {
    // Update timeline BPM
    project.timelineBox.bpm.setValue(newBpm);

    // Recalculate all clip durations
    audioRegions.forEach(({ box, audioDuration }) => {
      const newDuration = PPQN.secondsToPulses(audioDuration, newBpm);
      box.duration.setValue(newDuration);
      box.loopDuration.setValue(newDuration);
    });
  });
}
```

### Subscribe to Changes

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Subscribe to playing state
  const playingSub = project.engine.isPlaying.subscribe(obs => {
    setIsPlaying(obs.getValue());
  });

  // Subscribe to position (throttled)
  const positionSub = AnimationFrame.add(() => {
    setCurrentPosition(project.engine.position.getValue());
  });

  // Cleanup
  return () => {
    playingSub.terminate();
    positionSub.terminate();
  };
}, [project]);
```

## Troubleshooting

### No audio plays
- Check AudioContext state (may need `audioContext.resume()`)
- Verify cross-origin isolation headers
- Check browser console for errors

### Playhead doesn't move
- Ensure `AnimationFrame.start(window)` was called
- Check position subscription is active
- Verify engine is actually playing

### Clips in wrong position
- Double-check PPQN calculations
- Verify `totalDuration` matches your timeline
- Check pixel conversion formula

### Waveforms not rendering
- Subscribe to sample loader state
- Check peaks are available (`!peaksOption.isEmpty()`)
- Verify canvas has proper dimensions
