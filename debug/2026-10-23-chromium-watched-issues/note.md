# Chromium watched issues, measured on this repo's own probes

**Started:** 2026-10-23. **Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-22-chromium-watched-issues-measurement.md`.
**Spec:** `docs/known-vendor-issues.md`, "# Chromium / ## Watched — read from the tracker, not reproduced
here", plus the unmeasured half of the measured OPFS entry (436552046: the persisted usage going negative
after a delete and a restart).
**SDK:** none. The probes load no SDK: they say what Chrome does, not what the SDK repairs. Where an SDK
path is the witness (the first-read issue), the finding names the installed release.
**Page:** [`chromium-watched-issues-debug-demo.html?issue=<name>`](../../chromium-watched-issues-debug-demo.html)
(`src/demos/recording/chromium-watched-issues-debug-demo.tsx`; shared shape `src/lib/audit/chromiumWatched.ts`).

Each entry either moves to "Measured here" in the register with a figure, or stays watched with "not
reproduced on Chrome N, <date>" and the probe that failed to show it. A run that could not exercise the
condition reads `NOT CHECKED <reason>` and is recorded as such, never as "not reproduced".

## The issues

| `?issue=` | Chromium issue | What the probe does | Verdict words | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `first-read` | [571344687](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/571344687) — stale first clock read after a slow module load | Builds a worklet node right after `addModule()` resolves (a slow module, a large module, none), five runs each in a running context; the processor reports `currentFrame` from its constructor and first three `process()` calls, judged against the main thread's frame read just before the node was made | `STALE FIRST READ`, `FIRST READ TRUE`, `NOT CHECKED` | **reproduced**: `STALE FIRST READ` on Chrome 155, 2026-10-22 |
| `bfcache` | [575891839](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/575891839) — half-speed worklet clock after a back/forward-cache restore | Measures the context clock against `performance.now()` with a worklet tone and an oscillator control playing, navigates away and back; on `pageshow.persisted` re-measures and judges, otherwise records the `notRestoredReasons` | `HALF SPEED`, `NORMAL`, `NOT CHECKED` | not yet run |
| `suspend-resume` | [560233271](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/560233271) — distortion after suspend / resume cycles | A worklet-rendered 440 Hz tone into an analyser; a two-second baseline, then 20 `suspend()` / `resume()` cycles with a purity window after each, judged on harmonic purity against the baseline and on dropouts | `DISTORTED`, `CLEAN`, `NOT CHECKED` | not yet run |
| `capture-gaps` | [40103985](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40103985) — zero-filled gaps and duplicated blocks in `getUserMedia` input | Records 60 s of a `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` (`&source=loopback` or `mic`, at 48 000 and 44 100) through a worklet; counts zero runs of 100 frames or more after the head and 128-frame blocks identical to the one before | `GAPS`, `CLEAN`, `NOT CHECKED` | not yet run |
| `opfs-usage` | [436552046](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/436552046) / [401692415](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/401692415) — OPFS usage not counted for sync-handle writes, negative after a delete | Writes through a sync access handle in a worker, reads `estimate()` before, after the write and after the delete; the user quits and reopens Chrome and the page judges the restart reading on load (`&truncateFirst=1` for the reporter's workaround) | `NOT COUNTED`, `COUNTED`, `NEGATIVE USAGE`, `NOT CHECKED` | not yet run |
| `opfs-flush` | [40909520](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40909520) — slow `flush()` on Mac | Times 20 writes of 1 MiB and 20 of 16 MiB, each followed by `flush()`, in a worker; median, p95 and max per size | `MEASURED` (figures only: the tracker's claim is a comparison with other browsers this repo does not make) | not yet run |
| — | [541725401](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/541725401) / [40068799](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40068799) — a quota overrun returns a sentinel | No probe: needs the origin's quota exhausted or an incognito profile | — | out of scope, stays watched |
| — | [388871416](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/388871416) — `outputLatency` with a Bluetooth headset | No page probe: needs a Bluetooth output device (plan Task 7) | — | not yet run |

## Run recipe

1. Serve the repo over HTTPS on port 5173 (reuse a running dev server; do not start a second one):

   ```
   npm run dev -- --port 5173 --host 127.0.0.1 --strictPort
   ```

2. Open the page for one issue, one issue per page load, in Chrome with the window visible:

   ```
   https://localhost:5173/chromium-watched-issues-debug-demo.html?issue=first-read
   https://localhost:5173/chromium-watched-issues-debug-demo.html?issue=bfcache
   https://localhost:5173/chromium-watched-issues-debug-demo.html?issue=suspend-resume
   https://localhost:5173/chromium-watched-issues-debug-demo.html?issue=capture-gaps&source=loopback
   https://localhost:5173/chromium-watched-issues-debug-demo.html?issue=opfs-usage
   https://localhost:5173/chromium-watched-issues-debug-demo.html?issue=opfs-flush
   ```

3. Click **Run** with a real click (Playwright `click`, never a dispatched event): the audio starts from it.
   Do not edit anything under `src/` or `public/` while a run is on; Vite reloads the page.
4. Wait for `#audit-state[data-audit-state]` to read `done` (or `error`). It reads `idle`, then
   `running:<step>`. The verdict word is `#verdict[data-verdict]`; the figures it was judged on are in the
   table below it, with the browser's version and the date.
5. The envelope is written through the dev server's `/__verify` sink to
   `.verify-output/chromium-<issue>-<runToken>.json` (untracked). Its fields: `issue`, `chrome`, `date`,
   `runToken`, `verdict`, `figures`.

`bfcache` and `opfs-usage` judge on a later page load (after the restore, after the browser restart): the
page judges what the earlier run stored as soon as it loads, with no click, and saves that envelope.

## Findings

One section per issue, filled as each probe runs: the Chrome version and date, the verdict, the figures,
and what it means for the register entry.

### first-read (571344687)

**Reproduced.** Chrome 155 (macOS, Playwright's Chrome, window visible), 2026-10-22, 44 100 Hz, one
click, five runs per variant interleaved, each run in a fresh running context. Verdict
**`STALE FIRST READ`** on all three variants, 15 of 15 runs. Envelope
`.verify-output/chromium-first-read-mvk18ai3-q6py.json`; 0 console errors on the navigation.

| variant | loaded before the probe module | variant load (ms) | lag of the constructor read (quanta) | largest lag | jump, first to second call (quanta) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `none` | nothing | — | 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 | 5.8 ms | 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 |
| `large` | 12 000 exported functions | 14.2…27.1 | 8, 10, 10, 6, 8 | 29.0 ms | 9, 11, 11, 7, 9 |
| `slow` | a top level that busy-waits 100 ms | 104.2…106.1 | 36, 36, 36, 36, 36 | 104.5 ms | 37, 37, 37, 37, 37 |

The lag is the node's creation frame (the main thread's `currentTime` just before
`new AudioWorkletNode`) less the processor constructor's `currentFrame`; the first `process()` reads the
same stale frame, and the second reads one quantum past the creation frame in every run: the jump is the
lag plus one quantum, exactly. So the signature is the tracker's: the first reads date from about when
the context's first module load started, and the clock is true from the second call on.

- **The lag tracks the load time.** `slow` lags 104.5 ms after a 104–106 ms load; `large` lags 17–29 ms
  after a 14–27 ms load. `large` and `slow` differ as the tracker says (32–43 ms against 96–107 ms
  there); `large` is shorter here because this machine parses the generated module faster.
- **`none` is not a control.** The probe module is itself the context's first module load, so the run
  without a variant shows the issue at its smallest (2 quanta, 5.8 ms), not its absence. The rule
  "a run is stale when the lag exceeds one quantum and the second call jumps" holds it stale, which is
  correct: any processor made right after the context's first `addModule()` resolves reads late.

**What it means for the SDK (installed 0.0.177; read in the openDAW checkout, no new code).** The
engine worklet is built at boot after its module loads (`WasmEngine.ensureReady` awaits `addModule()`,
then compiles the engine's WASM, and the node follows), so it can sit in the issue's window whenever the
context is already running at boot (the window is open until the worklet thread renders its first
quantum). It does not read the clock in its constructor; its `process()`
stamps each quantum from `QuantumClock.advance(currentFrame)` (`lib-dsp/src/quantum-clock.ts`), whose
origin is the largest `currentFrame − calls·128` seen. A stale first read gives a low origin, and the
first true read (the second call, by the figures above) raises it, so from the second quantum on the
engine's frame is the true one. The `RecordingProcessor` uses the same clock and reports its
first-quantum frame `SETTLE_QUANTA` (16) calls late, "a stale first read is corrected by any true read
among the following quanta"; this probe's jumps land on the true frame at the second call, well inside
16. A recording's worklet is in any case made long after the recorder module loads (once, at engine
install), outside the window. The figure that says the repair holds end to end is the recording
start-alignment sweep on 0.0.177: netted placement +1.07…+1.17 ms
(`debug/2026-09-02-recording-start-alignment/note.md`, `changelogs/sdk-0.0.176-to-0.0.177-changes.md`).
A worklet that seeded a sample counter from its constructor's `currentFrame` would keep this probe's
lag for its whole life; none of this repo's worklets is known to, but that is the check for any new one.
